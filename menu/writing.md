[_Applied Computational Physics_](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/applied-computational-physics-9780198708643), published by _Oxford University Press_, is a comprehensive resource of topics and techniques interesting to theoretical and experimental physicists, engineers, and scientists in general.

The book is full of hands-on instructions, with examples and exercises written in modern C++ programming language.

I also have a [technical blog](../blog.html) (a very techy, geeky blog), meant mainly as a personal lab notebook. But if you are an ATLAS physicist or you work in scientific software programming, you might find some useful information in it.
