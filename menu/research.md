I have a *PhD* in *Particle Physics* and my main research activities are in the fields of
Data Analysis/Data Science, Data Visualization and Development of Scientific Software.

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [University of Pittsburgh](http://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/riccardo-maria-bianchi), but I am based at CERN, in Geneva (Switzerland), where I work within the ATLAS Experiment on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

In the last 11 years I have worked on very different topics, which let me acquire a broad knowledge of the needs and the possible issues involved in the design and running a scientific experiment.

In particular my activities focused on:

## Current work-in-progress projects

...
di' che hai promosso e iniziato progetti con istituti esterni, tra cui EPFL (Network visualization) e UNIGE (Machine learning applied to Language...la roba delle concordanze)
...



## 2012--2017 (*"University of Pittsburgh"*, USA)

* Development of Scientific Software
* Interactive Data Visualization
* Statistical Data Analysis / Data Science
* Machine learning techniques for data analysis
* Big Data analysis / Grid
* Geometrical data models, handling of geometry data
* Large scale graph data storing, mining and querying
* Networks Visualization
* Detector Description
* Math libraries
* 3D graphics

* Efficient data analysis with C++
* Multi-threading and Parallel Computing

* Parallel Data Analysis (Reduction???)
* --> better? Developing paralellel algorithms for efficient data reduction


* Digital Humanities: I started two collaboration on Digital Humanities with external institutes, to apply teh techniques and the tools I develop for Particle Physics in other fields
  * Visualization of Collaborations and Networks -- with EPFL -- focused on the Visualization of large collaborations of institutes and people, to extract information about the connections. That project implies complex tasks of scouting, collection and cleaning of very heterogeneus data (papers, theses, reports, HR data, collaboration data, ...)
  * Machine Learning and -- with UNIGE --



* Volunteer Computing
* In-situ data visualization for volunteer computing
* Outreach & Education:
  * interactive web-based data visualization  for Outraech & Educational projects
  * outreach content to explain things and engage. I really think that one of the scientist to-do is to give back some of teh acquired knolwedge to other people: each person has a job, our as scientists is studying, one has to give back


(GeoModel related)
* Data modeling for large datasets of eterogenous data
* Efficient Data handling Algorithms
* Small-memory-footprint modeling of data
* Data persistence

* Virtual Reality for Scientific Data Visualization


## 2010--2012 (*CERN*, Switzerland)

* Data Acquisition Systems and experiment's Run Control
* Big Data Handling and Management
* DB
* RealTime DB
* Data Visualization


## 2007--2010 (*"Freiburg Universit√§t"*, Germany)

* Searches of Supersymmetric (SUSY) particles and Extra Dimensions (UED), SUSY models
* Statistics
* Big Data analysis / Grid
* Design and Development of Data Analysis Frameworks
* Simulation
* MonteCarlo techniques


## 2006 (*"Roma Tre" University*, Italy)

* Calibration of the [*Muon Drift Tubes*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nima.2008.09.031) (MDT) [muon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon) detectors
* Statistical Data Analysis
* Simulation of physical systems
* MonteCarlo techniques
