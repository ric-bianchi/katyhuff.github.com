____________________________


This is the repository that holds the hompage for Katy Huff. It is a forked 
version of the Maori project on github. Details about Maori follow. 




Kiwi Grove's Maori
-------------------

Maori is an open-source personal portfolio page.

You make awesome code, but need a portfolio website. The only problem is your a developer, not a designer. That's where Maori comes in. By forking this project and changing editing a few lines of code, you have a sexy site and can go back to your code zone.

Installation
-------------------

Fork this project and upload to wherever you want to use it. Everything is done in HTML and CSS with nothing else needed.

index.html
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is where your going to change all your personal information, change the title to your name, change links, just edit the HTML and make it work.

Fonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To get sweet custom fonts go to http://code.google.com/webfonts  or http://typekit.com.

custom.css
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can completely customize the entire site to make your own flavor by editing 3 CSS variables, content background color, link color, and font family.

background.jpg
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Find a picture that makes you look awesome, then export it so that the width is 1280px. Overwrite the default picture and your good to go.

More coming soon...
