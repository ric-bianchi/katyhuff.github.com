I am a particle physicist working at <a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a> in Geneva (Switzerland) on the <a href="http://atlas.cern/">ATLAS Experiment</a>.

I am currently affiliated with the Department of <a href="http://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/">Physics and Astronomy</a> of the
<a href="http://www.pitt.edu/">University of Pittsburgh</a> (US) as Postdoctoral Fellow.

I coordinate the activities of the "Visualization" working group of the [HEP Software Foundation (HSF)](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/), which fosters common project and coordinated effort on data visualization among experiments, and of the ATLAS Experiment's "Going Virtual" group, which explores the possibilities of new technologies, like Virtual and Augmented Reality, in scientific data visualization.

Beside my scientific papers, I recently contributed to the book [_Applied Computational Physics_](/menu/writing.html), which is out now, published by Oxford University Press.
